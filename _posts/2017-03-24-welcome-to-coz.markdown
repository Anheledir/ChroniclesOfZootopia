You will find the cover art-work for all released chapters on this site. At the bottom of each page you will find the link to different webpages, where this story is published: 

 * [FanFiction.net][fanfiction] – _Comments and Reviews can be posted anonymously_
 * [Archive of our own][ao3] – _Comments and Reviews can be posted anonymously_
 * [Wattpad][wattpad] – _Rather modern design, includes multimedia elements and has a lot of high-quality content_

There is also a link to the YouTube-Channel with the recorded chapters (_if available_). I'm still going to write a short summary for all chapters in the next few weeks. And Maybe I will add some Trivia about writing those chapters, too. 

As I was often asked during the last weeks: "Will there be a 26th chapter???" – Yes, I'm at least planning to finish the 3rd season of my story, that is a total of 30 chapters. You can see my current progress at the bottom of this page. But will there be even more chapters, e.g. a 4th season?

I really would like to, and I have quite a nice storyline in my head for it with some action, funny fluff and also enough romantic scenes. _Will Judy and Nick for example be ready to catch a serial killer, that was already introduced in my first season?_

As Judy said: "_Try to make the world a better place_". Well, at least I tried with this story! So if you like it – or have feedback to improve it – just write a comment / review on one of those websites below or share the story on other pages so I know there are still enough people interested in a sequel of 'Chronicles of Zootopia'. Maybe this will motivate me enough to continue it. :)
