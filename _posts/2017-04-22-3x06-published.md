It took several months to finally finish the new chapter, but now you can read it on the usual websites!

Since Nick started to work for the ZPD, he and his old friend Finnick had no more contact. Even after being invited to the wedding of the couple he didn't made it to Bunnyburrow. But he gifted them some rare tickets to a soldold baseball home game of the Zootopia Red Paws against the Deerbrooke Eagles. Finally the day had come, and although Judy felt exhausted after her and her litter siblings birthday party the previous day, she insisted that they would meet with Finnick and go to the game. But the match shouldn't be the only exciting thing that day.
