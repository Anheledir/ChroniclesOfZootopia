I was obliviously browsing through a few of my daily links, when I stumbled accross a familiar looking image. And indeed, it's from the Chapter 8 Trailer: [Zootopia's #1 News Network][znn] ZNN had a [great review][znnAudioDrama] of my teamwork with Sean Dalglish, the audio drama version of my story!

As Andy Lagopos stated:

     Sean's accent is just the best.

And:

    Excellent work all around!

I can only repeat on this, Sean is really doing some great work and it's really fun to listen to him bringing my story to live!

If you don't already have, just follow the YouTube link at the bottom of this page and listen to the newest published chapter. And while you still have to wait for the new chapter 26 of the written story, there will be a little never-before-published [Bonus Chapter][1x11] to the first season in just a few weeks. :-)
