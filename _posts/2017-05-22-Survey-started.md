There is a short survey about Chronicles of Zootopia to come to know you better. ​Your answers will give me some valueable feedback how to make the story even better / more interesting for you with upcoming chapters. And if you don't like the story at all? Well, that's okay, too - tastes are different and I'm unable to please everybody. But your feedback is nevertheless important and appreciated!

As an additional thank-you for participating, you have the chance to see your very own character in the upcoming Season 4 of Chronicles of Zootopia! You decide it's name (as long as it is appropriate), it's species, appearences, ... I will keep a right of veto, but I'm sure we can agree on it. To participate in the sweepstake, just enter some details on the last page of the survey.

You're ready? Then [let's start][Survey], and thank you again for your help! :)
