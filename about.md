# About the story
When I started to write my little story, I was totally hyped by the "Zootopia" movie &ndash; and I'm still! I think it is just a wonderful story with great characters and characters evolvement. Also I like to write short-stories, but never bothered to publish them. Until now, that is - and right now I have no plans to end _Chronicles of Zootopia_, yet. 

I partitioned the story into different _seasons_ just like a television series. That's mainly because I only planned on writing ten chapters at first, but then decided to continue. This way it emerged, that I have one main-theme per season.
* __Season 1__ is establishing the world of _Chronicles of Zootopia_ and how it links to the movie. As I didn't write that kind of story before I experimented with some different writing styles. So there are some way too cheesy chapters as well as some early drama.
* __Season 2__ is way more fun and is deepening on the relationship between Nick and Judy - yes, I'm definitely a shipper of this _cute_ couple! Beside a few crime cases to solve there is also some big family event in Bunnyburrow, Nick has to attend with Judy.
* __Season 3__ has an overall dark mood with quite some drama and emotionally scenes. There is a big background-story evolving during the season that will even continue in the next one. But there are also some light and cheerful parts: Evelin is finally established as a permanent original character, there will be some sports event, a big party and more... We also learn some more details about Nick's and Judy's past, mainly as childs. So try to sit through this season, the next one is getting lighter again!

# About the Audio Drama
Fast-forward to December 2016: A few days until the old year ended, a Scot named Sean Dalglish contacted me via fanfiction.net and asked if I would allow him to read my story and publish the audio on his YouTube-channel. Well, I didn't even know that this was a thing ... but found a few recordings of other stories, and finally got in contact with Sean. He was kind enough to let me contribute right from the beginning, so actually Sean is narrating the whole chapters, imitating the different character-voices (some sounds really great, some a bit funny, but overall he is doing a fantastic job!). Some characters will even have a _guest voice_, they are also mentioned in the details for a chapter on this website. And I'm reading myself the chapter-quotes that I started to add with [chapter 10][1x10].

We are both really happy about every comment from you for the videos, so just go to the YouTube link below and give it a quick listen. Just a short request: If you already read the story, don't spoiler future events in comments of videos belonging to previous chapters. :)

# About the Art Work
Until I started with Sean on the Audio Drama, I had no art work at all for the story. I made a logo in the style of the original Zootopia-Logo, but that's all. As YouTube is requiring a video-upload, the first few chapters are using a static image and starting with [chapter 5][1x05] there is a short animated intro with headlines and end-credits. The artwork used for those &ndash; and now also as chapter-covers on this and other websites &ndash; are not unique for this story. We found them mostly via search-engines or forums, and I always try to give proper credit to the author! I'm really admiring people who can draw like this and they deserve all the credits for it, too. But right now I'm commissioning some original artwork and will publish it here as soon as it's finished!
