# About the story
When I started to write my little story, I was totally hyped by the "Zootopia" movie &ndash; and I'm still! I think it is just a wonderful story with great characters and characters evolvement. It's actual regarding current political events, it's funny and cute enough for all children to love it, and there are so many jokes and hidden hints for adults to be just hilarious! But as you are on my website regarding this fanfiction story, I always asume you already have your very-own reason why you just love that movie and the fandome that developed around it.

I always liked to write short-stories. I wrote quests for some mmorpg's, creating some D&D campaigns, technical articles for professional journals, and quite a lot of short stories I never bothered to publish. Well, with Zootopia at least that changed: I read quite a lot of comics and fanfictions, but they all were missing a few elements I wanted to see myself. So i decided to wrote a short-story about Zootopia ... and then added another chapter to it, and another one. Finally I decided to publish those chapters on [Archive of our own][ao3] - and even got some nice reviews for it.

Season 1 is establishing the world of _Chronicles of Zootopia_ and how it fits into the original Zootopia story. Season 2 is for the most chapters a lot of fluffy-happy storyline. There are also two crime-cases to make things a bit more interesting. In Season 3 I tried something different, giving it a way more darker theme with more action and emotional scenes. I'm not a big fan of such stories myself, but I tried to make it still interesting. And without saying too much: Even if the main theme is much darker / sadder in that season, I'm loving Nick and especially Judy way too much to do something extreme. If you liked season 1 and 2, I can promise you that you will also love season 3! :)


# About the Audio Drama
Fast-forward to December 2016: A few days until the old year ended, a Scot named Sean Dalglish contacted me via fanfiction.net and asked if I would allow him to read my story and publish the audio on his YouTube-channel. Well, one of my greatest wishes was to have at least a single piece of unique artwork or even a small comic depending on one of the chapter for my story. The best I can document myself is some stickfigure like XKCD. But someone reading my fanfiction? I didn't knew back than that this was even a thing ... but found a few recordings of other stories, and finally got in contact with Sean!

He also offered me to proofread my story &ndash; something I was looking for quite a while but I didn't found anyone to do it. Well, now I had not only a proofreader but also someone doing some audio-recording of my fanfiction! He was kind enough to let me contribute right from the beginning. So actually Sean is narrating the whole chapters, imitating the different characters with different voices (some sounds really great, some a bit funny, but overall he is doing a fantastic job!). For a few chapters we have even some &quot;special guests&quot; lending their voice to single characters. And starting with [chapter 10][1x10] I'm reading the new intro-quote of the chapters myself.

We are both really happy about every comment from you for the videos, so just go to the YouTube link below and give it a quick listen. Just a short request: If you already read the story, don't spoiler future events in comments of videos belonging to previous chapters. :)

# About the Art Work
Until I started with Sean on the Audio Drama, I had no art work at all for the story. I made a logo in the style of the original Zootopia-Logo, but that's all. I can work with Photoshop to make some retouching of existing images, but I'm no artist at all. As I mentioned before, I can draw some stickfigures, but even those are looking horrible. But as YouTube is requiring a video-upload, we had to put at least some image to the audio to upload it. The first few chapters are using a static image, and starting with [chapter 5][1x05] I created a short animated intro with sub-chapters and even some end-credits. The artwork used for those &ndash; and now even as chapter covers on this and other websites &ndash; are not unique at all. I found them after quite a lot of image-searching in different forums, and I swear I always try to give proper credit to the author! I'm really admiring people who can draw like this and they deserve all the credits for it, too.

The only thing that makes me a little bit sad is, that there is no really unique artwork for my story. There were a few people messaging me if they are allowed to make some, but I never saw any result. I really would love to see just a few scenes, interpreted by someone and made into a drawing. An own short comic would be like x-mas, eastern and birthday together, but a nice drawing based on the story would be really something stunning. But things can always change, maybe my story will inspire some talented illustrator someday enough to create a small piece of art. If so: Please make sure to show me! I will switch the current cover arts anytime with a specialized picture, or just show it on this website here for everyone to see! :)
