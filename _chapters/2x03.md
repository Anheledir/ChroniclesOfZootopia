It's one of Nick and Judy's well-deserved free weekends when the sly rabbit is proving her boyfriend that being a predator doesn't necessarily make you also the better hunter. And even when some old-school Zuber driver is dampening the mood slightly, things are getting pretty heated nevertheless. Hey, it's their free weekend and bunnies are having desires, right? But the next disruption is already waiting on the horizon - as well as some big news!
