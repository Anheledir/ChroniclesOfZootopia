It’s weekend again and Nick was allowed by Doctor Greenwood to travel back to Zootopia. Since the two ZPD Officers also finished their investigation of the zooicide on an old rabbit, resulting in the only suspect - a wolf - being discharged of all accusations, some of Judy’s siblings have a raising mistrust again for the Fox. But taking part for another predator is not the only accusation against Nick that has been told to Judy. And old and unconscious worries are starting to unsettle her again. In the end, it all leads to an emotional outburst between Judy and Nick, their relationship is on a razor’s edge.

## Trivia
- This chapter was never before published and is currently exclusiv available for the audio drama by Sean Dalglish. You can listen to it with the YouTube link at the bottom.
- I wrote this Bonus-Chapter as a _thank you-gift_ to Sean and all listeners / commenters to the audio drama we are creating and publishing each week.
- There is a short comment by Sean at the beginning of this chapter with a message to our listeners.
- There is also a short comment from myself at the end!
- We have a special guest, lending her voice a new character in "The Vixen"!
- The bonus chapter fills in the gap what happened between Judy and Nick solving their case in Bunnyburrow and arriving back at home again.
- As I wrote that chapter several months later as the surrounding chapters, it has a slightly different - but also improved - writing style.
