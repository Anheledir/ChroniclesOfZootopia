It's not only Nick who has some romantical ideas, but also Judy. And after our fox set the bar really high with his proposal and wedding two weeks ago, Judy worked hard to get him a gift that will eventually pull at Nick's heartstrings. At the same time it's giving us some insight into Nick and Judy's past and a few events we didn't know about, yet.

## Trivia
 * The chapter was originally released at the turn of the year 2016/2017, the time to make a retrospective view what happend in the past year. So this chapter is also some kind of summary of the most important waypoints of the whole _Chronicles of Zootopia_ story.
