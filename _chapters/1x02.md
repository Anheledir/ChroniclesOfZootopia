Nick and Judy got no sleep the night after the Gazelle concert, starting the next day a bit weary. After getting assigned a new case from Chief Bogo they start their investigations. But instead of a smooth evening with some well deserved time to revive, Judy's parents announce a surprise-visit in Zootopia for some dinner. But their visit comes not without some ulterior motives.
