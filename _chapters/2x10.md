Their free week in Bunnyburrow after their wedding is nearly over and Judy wanted to show Nick some more secrets of her parent's burrow. So they are spending a relaxing afternoon in their subterranean sauna and spa, snoozing alone for a while on some loungers. But Nick had something completely different in his mind ...

__Content-Warning:__ This chapter is way more explicit regarding the sexual relationship between Nick and Judy, giving some light insights without getting filthy. But the content could be counted as mature nevertheless!

## Trivia
 * The content of this chapter is not really relevant for the main-storyline, so you can skip it without losing the thread.
 * I was asked by quite a lot of readers to go into more details for their sexual relationship, especially their pred-prey-games. This chapter is my answer to those requests.
 * No, Judy is not getting pregnant during the events in this chapter as she isn't in heat anymore.
 * The poem about _darkness_ that Nick is whispering is from J.R.R. Tolkien (The Hobbit)
