Even rabbits are celebrating their birthdays! Maybe not with the whole family, but most of the time the particular litter is meeting and celebrating their own birthday together. And this time Judy's litter-siblings Ralph and Clara came to Zootopia to spend some well-deserved time together. But there is also some surprise-guest and together they had a full weekend of fun with game parties - including some embarassinging and even sexy truth-or-dare game, watching movies together, going shopping, talking about old times and finally having a big party with karaoke together with quite some friends and colleagues in a bar! Could this evening get even any better?
