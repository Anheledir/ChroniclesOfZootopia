A rabbit was murdered in Bunnyburrow and the strong subject seems to be his neighbor, a grey wolf. For the local police a zooicide (a mammal killing another mammal) is such a rarely occasion that they asked the ZPD for administrative support - and Bogo is telling Judy off for this case as she wanted to stay a bit longer in Bunnyburrow anyway. While Nick has still to stay in his hospital bed, Judy is examining the crime scenes and collecting all kind of different evidences. Earlier that day she finally had met her parents again and they seem to be really sorry about what happend. Even when Judy asked them if she and Nick could stay for a few more days in their guest room, Bonnie eagerly agreed. And even Stu recognized it as an opportunity to come to know the fox better.

## Trivia
- The chapter was published as an audio drama with an additional delay of one week because of it's length. Still, we didn't want to split the story into multiple parts and created a short teaser instead.
- Everytime Judy is visiting the crime scene or a suspect, another song of a CSI show is playing in the background.
- The daughter of the sheep that is working at the frontdesk in the Bunnyburrow police station was meant to be the same official character from Judy's play as a kit. Her name wasn't mentioned in the movie so I called her _Emily Croach_. I only later became aware that her official firstname was _Sharla_, so I changed her name in the Appendix to _Emily-Sharla Croach_.
