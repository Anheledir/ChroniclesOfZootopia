Judy's whole family including all her several hundred brothers and sisters, her friends and colleagues and even Evelin: They all were in cahoots together with Nick for the last few weeks to make this epic wedding-proposal even possible. Just half an hour ago she was cursing that Nick isn't taking their relationship seriously, that he always seems to be prepared to have an ace in the whole to vanish...
She didn't know how she managed to say 'yes' to his proposal, because right now she was unable to speak, move, think or anything other. But that crazy evening had a few more surprises for Judy: The proposal would be her smallest problem in a while, thanks to _Evelin and Sven_.

## Trivia
 * The last two wedding rings that Judy and Nick selected and have to decide between are looking similiar to those:

 * They ultimately decide for the rings on the right side of the picture.
 * The small parts of the songs Nick and Judy are singing in Bunnyburrow are part of the _Elephant Love Medley_ from _Moulin Rouge_ - one of Judy's favorite movies.
 * Even if it is only for one day, but Stu had already replaced the wooden frame of Nick and Judy in the big living room with one made of silver when Nick and Judy went to Bunnyburrow.
 * Instead of having the wedding-chapter directly after the proposal I thought it would be nice to have some insights into all the necessary preparations they still have to do. Also there is quite some insecurity on Judy's side, but also on Nick's.
