quote:
    text: "Better to be violent if there’s violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of non-violence to cover impotence. [...] I object to violence because when it appears to do good the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent."

During a raid the ZPD found indices, that a gang of armed and dangerous mammals will rob a bank in a few days. A task force is assembled to search for the still fugitive gang leader and to identify the target and further accomplices. But after all clues were leading nowhere, Judy had an idea to make some progress yet again - much to Nick's discomfort.
