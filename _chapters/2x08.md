      With the poison I'll be<br>
      Quantum tangled you see,<br>
      Thus alive and dead both all the while.«

Nick managed together with Chief Bogo that most of their colleagues and friends from the precinct could attend the wedding. But one day later, after they took the last train back to Zootopia, they all had to work again and most of them in the early shift. That is everyone but Nick and Judy who got a full week of vacation as a present from Bogo. But that is not the only one missing: Benjamin Clawhauser, the receptionist and one of Bogo's most reliable employees, didn't turn up to work and couldn't be reached via phone. In a small search operation Bogo even called the Hopps' burrow in Bunnyburrow. Eventually Clawhauser is found by Nick in one of the Hopps' barns, still confused and with a proverbial hangover. He isn't too sure what really happend last night, but there was a lot of booze and bunnies...

## Trivia
 * The title and the quote are hints to the fact, that nobody really knows what actually happened: Clawhauser could have been really naughty with those bunnies or absolutely nothing happend. As long as nobody investigates or articulate it clearly, both could be true.
 * A few hints what might had happend will be revealed in some chapters of season 3 as a small side-story.
 * Nick's mother stayed also overnight in the burrow and drove back to Zootopia with the same train as Clawhauser. It's just not mentioned in the story because I forgot about it.
