The ZPD was doing it's best to find the kidnapped Evelin, but all investigations proved useless right now. Finally, Nick decides to take matters into his own hands: A decision he will have to pay a high price for, having to make an impossible decission. After the fox also vanished, Chief Bogo is assuming control of the investigations. However, what he and his colleagues found made even him losing his tongue. The Internal Investigations Department is impeding the investigations further. And when Judy decides to do her own thing against Chief Bogo's direct orders, Sven has to ask himself how far he is willing to go to rescue his wife.
