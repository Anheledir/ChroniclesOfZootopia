It's the second day that Nick is laying in Bunnyburrow's hospital in coma, and Judy isn't leaving his side not even to eat something. Did she love this fox? Well, she would have answered _yes_ but wasn't all too sure to be honest. Things developed rather quickly the last few weeks and they were rushed into announcing their fresh relationship to her parents way sooner than planned. Everything was just somewhat of an experiment with both of them hoping that it would last. But the events the day before triggered something in Judy: Her fox saved one of her little sisters against his nature and without hesitating. When his warm blood was running over her own paws she really feared for his life and she was sure: She didn't want to be ever again without Nick!
But for now she had to do the one thing she was really bad at: Waiting. The only one she allowed to visit her at the hospital was Evelin, her tower of strength for so long. What if Nick will not wake up again? Or will be paralyzed? How could everything could go so horrible wrong when the last week was just pure joy...
