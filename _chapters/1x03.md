Even on their free weekend Nick and Judy are arresting some bad guy who tried to sell them solen good. We also learn about some special abilities of rabbits and foxes - those big ears and long nose must be good for something at least; and Nick of course commited a blunder, causing some embarressment for his little bunny. But at the end of the week the famous Zootopia Diversity Festival is starting, including some challenging sporting competitions. Judy is eager to participate and quickly convinced Nick to compete in a competition together as a team. But our sly fox has one condition Judy has to agree with, first...

## Trivia
 * The idea for the diversity festival is roughly based on the Christopher Street Day in Germany, a gay pride parade
 * If you ask yourself when was Nick's and Judy's _first time_, it's right at the end of this chapter when she claims her trophy. Up until this point there were at most some petting.
 * After publishing this chapter for the first time I asked my readers, how Judy's parent's would actually react to her being dating a fox. Are both okay with it? Is only one of them raging or even both? What about her siblings? The result was kind of unambigous - and I had to rewrite the following chapter before I could release it.
