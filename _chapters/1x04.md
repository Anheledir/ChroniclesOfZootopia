The party after the Zootopia Diversity Festival on Friday night was really exhausting and since Judy's parents couldn't reach her the whole evening on her phone they were caring too much again - especially her mother! In the early hours they called again and this time Judy heard the ringtone, even if she mistook it for some dream at first. Well ... it turned out that the sporting events and interviews were even shown on TV in Bunnyburrow and Judy's parents were already aware of the fact that Judy had some kind of boyfriend. Actually it was a misunderstanding of the reporter, but then again it wasn't wrong at all. But now she had to drive to Bunnyburrow for an extended weekend to _present_ Nick to her family not only as her partner on the force. The opinions are divided in the burrow, but eventually the fox didn't feel very welcomed. But when everybody thought that it couldn't get any worse, it got ...

## Trivia
 * The scene at the dinner table was inspired by Shrek 2, when the Oger and his wife met her parents and they _eat_ together.
 * In the audio drama the same soundtrack was played in that scene as in the movie.
 * Originally this was the only chapter where Judy's little sister was called _Amie_. In all following one's she was called _Annie_. This was corrected during recording the audio drama.
 * _Amie_ was inspired by the official character _Cotton_, that was visible in a few scenes in the Movie, but never mentioned by name. As I heard about her name only later, I made _Amie_ an Original charatcer and let _Cotton_ stay in the story as another sister of Judy.
 * Bonnie Hopps is totally aware that Judy is having romantic feelings towards Nick, trying several times to talk with her husband in private.
