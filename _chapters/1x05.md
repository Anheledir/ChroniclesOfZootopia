From sheer fear and due to disadvantageous angles nobody had realized what actually happened down at the trees where the waggon crashed. Stu Hopps only saw how the waggon was running towards his little girl, who couldn't move out of fear. But the waggon and the trees were blocking the view of Nick, who reacted as quick as a wink and eventually managed to save the little bunny _Amie_ at the last moment. Unaware of the fox brave action Judy, her brother and her father started to argue again - but the smart little bunny mentioned Nick's name in the right moment for Judy to get suspicious. Where _was_ Nick, actually? Little did Judy know how near her beloved fox-friend was right now...

## Trivia
 * This is the first time I'm introducing a new and important original character: Evelin Hopps, a rabbit one year younger than Judy and her best friend. She even looks nearly the same as her. She is going to play a minor role for the upcoming chapters and is eventually promoted to a main-character later in the story.
