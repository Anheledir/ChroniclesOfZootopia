On the third day Judy wasn't the only one awake in the hospital bed: Nick finally woke up from his coma and seemed to be okay, despite some dizzyness, a headache, a broken arm and leg. But even when he could leave the hospital maybe in a few days, he had to come to a regular checkup for at least a week and would not be able to go on patrol with his rabbit partner for quite a while. Also with Nick being awake again, there are a few more of Judy's siblings who are eager to visit her new best friend eventually! But while Eve is still trying to persuade her older sister to finally have a talk with her parents about what happened, Judy is facing a new problem: Her additional vacation days are ending soon and she must let Nick left behind in Bunnyburrow to start working at the ZPD again if she cannot persuade Chief Bogo to give her a few more free days. The Cape buffalo isn't really inclined to give in on her wish, but has an interesting proposal for Judy.

## Trivia
 * Nick is never mentioning the fact, that he actually wanted to leave Bunnyburrow last Saturday and was already waiting for the bus back to the station. He wanted to break up with Judy to prevent that she has to take side between her parents and him. But when he realized she actually stayed at his side for the whole time, it was obvious to him that she had already made her choice - for his benefit. There was no need for him to bring up that topic again now.
