After their wedding, Judy and Nick still had quite some work to do: If you have a few hundred of guests there are quite a lot of gifts to open. And worst of all: Writing cards of thanks to every single one! But there are also some gifts that didn't fit into a box, and Judy isn't sure how Nick might react. But what would some vacation be to our beloved ZPD officers, when there would be no crime to investigate in their private time? At first it seems just like something odd, but boring. But Judy is too officious, again...
