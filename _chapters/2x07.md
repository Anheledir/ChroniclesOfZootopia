The moment Nick realised that everything really has worked out as planned for him and absolutely nothing went wrong, he got a panic attack. That seems all too good to be really true. But mercifully his little bunny knows exactly how he feels and managed to soothe him again. But not for too long, the next day is quite stressfull, and there are only a few hours left to finish all preparations. And about an hour before the wedding the rings and even the wedding dresses are still missing...
