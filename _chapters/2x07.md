The moment Nick realised that everything really has worked out as planned for him and absolutely nothing went wrong, he got a panic attack. That seems all too good to be really true. But mercifully his little bunny knows exactly how he feels and managed to soothe him again. But not for too long, the next day is quite stressfull, and there are only a few hours left to finish all preparations. And about an hour before the wedding the rings and even the wedding dresses are still missing...

## Trivia
 * It's unmentioned in the chapter, but the wedding actually happens during the mating season of foxes.
 * The _Smithery Eregions_ Ralph mentions are a reference to _The Lord of the Rings_, obviously also known in Bunnyburrow.
 * Originally there were some concrete songs mentioned the band played during the party. Because they had no relation to the story and the audio drama is using it's own background-music, they were later removed.
 * For YouTube the video of the audio drama got a special treatment for this chapter with a unique titel- and lower-third-animation.
 * The last song of the audio drama is a Zootopia Cover of _Shut up and dance_ by _Walk the Moon_, the lyrics telling the story of Nick and Judy in the movie.
 * Originally the wedding was in a church, despite the fact I already wrote in chapter [2x05] that it will taking place in the community hall. This was corrected for the audio drama, because I want to leave religion mostly out of the story
 * Michael Hopps, the Justice of the Peace performing the wedding ceremony, was already mentioned in [1x06]. He performed the wedding ceremony in Judy's dream, too!
 * A picture of Nick's and Judy's wedding rings including the choosen diamonds can be seen within the trivia to [2x06]. The picture is also visible in the end-credits of the YouTube video for the audio drama.
