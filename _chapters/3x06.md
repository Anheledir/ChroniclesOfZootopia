    text: "That's baseball, and it's my game. Y' know, you take your worries to the game, and you leave 'em there. You yell like crazy for your guys. It's good for your lungs, gives you a lift, and nobody calls the cops. Pretty girls, lots of 'em."

Since Nick started to work for the ZPD, he and his old friend Finnick had no more contact. Even after being invited to the wedding of the couple he didn't made it to Bunnyburrow. But he gifted them some rare tickets to a soldold baseball home game of the Zootopia Red Paws against the Deerbrooke Eagles. Finally the day had come, and although Judy felt exhausted after her and her litter siblings birthday party the previous day, she insisted that they would meet with Finnick and go to the game. But the match shouldn't be the only exciting thing that day.

# Trivia
- Writing this chapter had a close resemblance to the movie script of Zootopia: countless rewrites and story-changes, and the end-result has nothing to do with what I originally started three months ago.
- As I never saw a baseball game myself, I had to look up some rules for this chapter. The reportage in the stadium was heavily inspired by the song 'Paradise by the dashboard light' from Meatloaf.
- There is nearly no Zootopia artwork available with a baseball-theme so I made something more of a placeholder. If anyone would create something more suiteable it would be really great! :-)
