    text: "A family is a place where minds come in contact with one another. If these minds love one another, the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden. But, if these minds get out of harmony with one another, it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden."

## Trivia
 * The original chapter ended after Nick and Judy left the park. For the audio drama I wrote a new scene that nearly doubled the amount of words.
 * Lorraine, who is voicing Nick's mother Martha, is also the mother of Sean who is reading the audio drama.
