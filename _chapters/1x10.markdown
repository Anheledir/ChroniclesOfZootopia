After Nick's dismissal from the Bunnyburrow Hospital and his arrival at the Hopps' farm, his first meeting with Judy's father Stu since the accident is still pending. But up until then Judy's younger sister and best friend Evelin is showing Nick around the burrow, interrupting Judy who wanted to confess something to the fox in the moment her sister entered the room. A bit twitchy they all met for dinner again, and Bonnie's attempts for some light table talk are leading to more embarrassing moments between Nick, Judy and her family.

The next morning our little bunny cop is resuming her investigations on the zooicide with Nick helping her to revising and interpreting the evidence. It soons becomes clear, that there are some inconsistencies and the current suspect might be even clean-handed. Will they solve this case in the end? In the meantime, Evelin is making plans to sort out Nick's personal status with her family.

## Trivia

- Due to the length of the chapter and the story having a natural break around halfway through, the audio drama is published in two parts.
- A "homicide" is a human killing another human, but as there are no humans in Zootopia, and the prefix 'zoo-' is for animals, an animal killing another animal is called a "zooicide" within this story. Not to be confused by a suicide, someone killing him- or herself. 
- The amount of litters rabbits have and their size is based on real facts, but reduced for obvious reasons. Antropomorphic animals are not only following their instincts anymore but also considering other things affecting their family life.
- In the beginning of the movie 'Zootopia' it is said that Judy has 275 siblings. There is a good case to believe that now - nearly twenty years later - there are even more of them.
- Nick being Judy's first boyfriend is supporting her glowing commitment for him after that short time. In the movie she was rather naive in the beginning, indicating that she had not a lot of relationships with other mammals beside her family.
