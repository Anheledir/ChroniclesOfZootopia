- review: "Your Nick and Judy characterization is on point. I love how they interact with each other, their light hearted banter and also the more serious/heartfelt moments. They really just feel genuine. I love your OC's. When we first met Evelin in part 1, she was just instant likeable and Ralph, Sven and Clara, I love them all. I love the drama/suspense you're adding to the story, but the slice of life is definitely what I love the most. You are pulling it of so well and I just can't stop gobbling it up."
